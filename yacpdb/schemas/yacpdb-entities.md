# The YACPDB entities format

## Overview

An entity is something a chess composition can have a reference to. For example, a composition can reference a
certain person as one of it authors or a certain magazine as a place of its original publication.
There are currently 4 supported types of entities: **persons**, **sources**, **tourneys** (that is composing
tourneys, solving tourneys are actually sources) and **keywords**.

Just like the compositions, the entities are manipulated as [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
wiki-documents. The
formal [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)s for each of the entity types can be found here:

* [yacpdb-person.schema.json](yacpdb-person.schema.json)
* [yacpdb-source.schema.json](yacpdb-source.schema.json)
* [yacpdb-tourney.schema.json](yacpdb-tourney.schema.json)
* [yacpdb-keyword.schema.json](yacpdb-keyword.schema.json)

Below is informal documentation-by-example.

## Person
A composition can reference a **person** as an author or as a judge (who awarded the distinction).
```yaml
familyname: Петков
givennames: Петко Андонов
foreignids:
  - domain: database.wfcc.ch
    id: 116786
comments:
  - A Grandmaster of Chess Composition, has 666 (or pretty close) FIDE Album points, which is an absolute record
```
The only required field is `familyname`, `givennames` is optional, note, that the latter is not a list.
The only possible value for `foreignids.domain` at the moment is **database.wfcc.ch**.
`foreignids.id` is an integer, it can be found, for example, by clicking the "Export XML" button at the
[composers's page](https://database.wfcc.ch/index.php?-table=composers&-action=browse&-recordid=composers%3Fid%3D116786).

**There is no point in copying the information from the WFCC database into the YACPDB comments.**
As long as we have the correct id, it can be fetched automatically and kept up-to-date.

## Source
A composition can reference a **source** as a place of the original publication or of a reprint.
```yaml
name: feenschach
type: magazine
foreignids:
  - domain: database.wfcc.ch
    id: 255
comments:
  - I should have a meaningful comment here, but I don't
```
The only required field is `name`. All comments regarding the `foreignids` above apply to the sources as well.

Possible values for `type` are:
* magazine
* newspaper
* booklet
* award booklet
* book
* anthology
* article
* lecture
* solving event
* website

## Tourney
This is for composing tourneys. Solving tourneys are sources with type "solving event".
```yaml
name: SuperProblem TT-420
comments:
  - This could be a good place to copy the tourney theme of the thematic tourney
  - A link to the award maybe
```
The only required field is `name`. 

## Keyword
The purpose of the keywords is to filter the entries. It is desired that keywords should be as generic as
possible and apply to many entries. Users should be able to narrow the searches by combining the keywords.
Bad: `Longest kingwalk`, better: `Kingwalk` + `Length record`
```yaml
name: Zilahi
comments:
  - |
    Originally the theme applied only for helpmates in two with a set play, but modern usage is
    much broader. In essense, the theme implies an exchange (reciprocal or cyclical) of functions of pieces, 
    where one function is "be captured" and the other is "fulfill stipulation".  
```
The only required field is `name`.
